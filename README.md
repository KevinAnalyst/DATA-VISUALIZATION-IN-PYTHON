DATA VISUALIZATION IN PYTHON

Data visualization refers to the techniques for delivering descriptive insights from data by use of graphic hints such as charts, graphs and so on. This usually helps in more understanding of big data to extract information for different domains in decision making.
Python can be secondhand in data projection apart from the likes of tableau and R which I always use. In this project we are going to plot different graphs and charts with the use of libraries that is matplotlib and seaborn. Also we are going to plot tableau in python with the help of pygwalker package.


The plots are as follows;



1.	Bar plot

2.	Histogram

3.	Boxplot

4.	Scatterplot

5.	Line plot
